    "#### **Specific Question**  \n",
    "Can an Regular player's `age` be used to predict their total accumulated playing hours?  \n",

    "- Players with higher **played hours** tend to have a higher experience level.  \n",
    "- Older players may approach the game differently, leading to variations in skill progression compared to younger ones.  \n",
    "- Subscription status and gender may reflect different levels of engagement or playstyle, which could be linked to skill development.  \n",
    "- The dataset provides key player attributes, such as `played_hours`, `age`, `gender`, and `subscribe`, which allow for exploring potential trends and relationships between player characteristics and experience levels.  \n",

    "#### **Plan on Data Wrangling** \n",
    "- Load and read **players.csv**.  \n",
    "- Remove datasets with missing values to ensure data completeness.  \n",
    "- Select relevant variables: `experience`, `age`, and `played_hours`.  \n",
